        <p>Who would’ve thought?</p>
        <br>
        <p>That we’d make it out the trenches of Hinge, through the streets of IG to Facetiming pretty much every day.
            Mara, I can’t even begin to put into words how much I’ve loved getting to know you but I’ll try my best.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It’s been about two weeks since we started talking yet, I feel like we talk as if we’ve been close since we
            were young.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You bring a light and joyful humor to every conversation we have but also to the people around you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Not only are you insanely beautiful and super intelligent, you are one of the most mature people I’ve ever
            met and I love that about you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even when people try you and take your presence for granted, you hold your head high and handle everything
            with grace.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Never let anyone dim your light. Keep shining and sharing your joy for life with those around you.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Even though we are friends(for the time being🤞🏾), I’ve found myself really loving being around you and I
            hope we can stay connected for years to come.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is a small token of my appreciation and love for you Mara. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Happy Valentines Day! 💗</p>
